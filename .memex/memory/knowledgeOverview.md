# Knowledge Overview - Cursor Workspace (2025 Edition)

## Purpose
This memory file provides a single-page reference of all rule and workflow documents contained in the **.cursor** directory as of 2025-01-15.  It exists to give any LLM immediate situational awareness of the current authoritative guidelines, highlighting areas that differ from pre-2024 training data and explicitly noting mandatory Context7 usage.

## Context7 Integration (MANDATORY)
All development activities **must**:
1. Resolve library IDs via `mcp_context7-mcp_resolve-library-id`.
2. Fetch docs via `mcp_context7-mcp_get-library-docs`.
3. Persist retrieved docs under `llm-context-library/` with date stamps (2025-01-15 or newer).
4. Reference retrieved docs in code comments and memory updates.
5. Use web search only as a fallback with multi-source verification.

Failure to comply triggers automated validation failures and blocks CI.

## 2025 Documentation Guarantee
All rule and workflow documents in this repository have been **fully updated for 2025**.  Significant updates versus older (≤2024) material include:
- Full Bun v1 adoption across scripts and CI.
- Web3.js v2 code patterns replacing v1 examples.
- ZK-Compression service integration examples.
- Enhanced compliance sections for Digital Services Act 2024.
- New performance benchmarks aligned with Solana Devnet 1.16.

Any external documentation retrieved via Context7 is likewise validated to be **2025 current**.

## Quick Navigation Index
```
.rules/                  – All governance markdown rules
.workflows/              – Automated operational playbooks
.memory/                 – Live project & product context (this file lives here)
llm-context-library/     – External docs (Context7 fetches)
```

> **Usage**: LLMs should read this file **first** before diving into individual rules to gain orientation and avoid outdated assumptions.
