## Deployment Procedures

### 1. Backend Deployment (API Server)

#### Pre-deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Verify environment
cd packages/api-server
bun install
bun run build
bun run test

# 2. Database migration (if needed)
bun run prisma:migrate:deploy

# 3. Security check
bun run security:scan
```

#### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build production image
docker build -t pod-api:latest -f Dockerfile.prod .

# 2. Deploy to staging first
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d

# 3. Run smoke tests
bun run test:smoke

# 4. Deploy to production (if staging passes)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

#### Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Health check endpoints responding
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Rate limiting functioning
- [ ] Logging and monitoring active

### 2. Frontend Deployment

#### Pre-deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build and test
cd packages/frontend
bun install
bun run build
bun run test:e2e

# 2. Performance audit
bun run audit:performance
```

#### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build production assets
bun run build:production

# 2. Deploy to CDN/hosting platform
bun run deploy:staging

# 3. Run integration tests
bun run test:integration

# 4. Deploy to production
bun run deploy:production
```

#### Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads correctly
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] API integration working
- [ ] Authentication flows working
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Error tracking active

### 3. CLI Package Deployment

#### Pre-deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Version bump and changelog
cd packages/cli
npm version patch  # or minor/major
git add . && git commit -m "Release v$(cat package.json | jq -r .version)"

# 2. Build and test
bun run build
bun run test:all
```

#### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Publish to npm
npm publish

# 2. Create GitHub release
gh release create v$(cat package.json | jq -r .version) \
  --title "CLI v$(cat package.json | jq -r .version)" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md
```

### 4. SDK Deployment

#### TypeScript SDK
```bash
cd packages/sdk-typescript/sdk
npm version patch
bun run build
bun run test:all
npm publish
```

#### Rust SDK
```bash
cd packages/sdk-rust/sdk-rust
cargo test
cargo publish
```

### 5. MCP Server Deployment

#### Pre-deployment Steps
```bash
cd packages/mcp-server
bun install
bun run build
bun run test:all
```

#### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build Docker image
docker build -t pod-mcp-server:latest .

# 2. Deploy to container registry
docker push pod-mcp-server:latest

# 3. Update deployment configuration
kubectl apply -f k8s/mcp-server.yaml
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures for > 5 minutes
- Error rate > 5% for > 2 minutes
- Response time > 2s for > 3 minutes
- Database connection failures

### Manual Rollback Process

#### Backend Rollback
```bash
# 1. Identify last known good version
docker images | grep pod-api

# 2. Rollback to previous version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker tag pod-api:previous pod-api:latest
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 3. Verify rollback
curl -f http://api.pod-protocol.com/health
```

#### Frontend Rollback
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment
bun run deploy:rollback

# 2. Verify application functionality
bun run test:smoke:production
```

#### Database Rollback
```bash
# 1. Restore from backup (if schema changes)
pg_restore -d production_db backup_pre_deployment.sql

# 2. Run rollback migrations (if available)
bun run prisma:migrate:rollback
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Application Health**: Response times, error rates, uptime
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network
- **Business Metrics**: User activity, transaction volumes
- **Security**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Service down, error rate > 10%
- **Warning**: Response time > 1s, error rate > 2%
- **Info**: Deployment events, configuration changes

### Notification Channels
- **Critical**: PagerDuty, Slack #alerts, SMS
- **Warning**: Slack #monitoring, Email
- **Info**: Slack #deployments

---

## Security Considerations

### Pre-deployment Security
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] Container image security scan
- [ ] Code security analysis (SAST)
- [ ] Infrastructure security review

### Runtime Security
- [ ] WAF rules updated
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] API rate limiting active
- [ ] Database access controls verified
- [ ] Logging and audit trails active

---

## Performance Optimization

### Pre-deployment Performance
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] CDN configuration validated
- [ ] Caching strategies implemented

### Post-deployment Performance
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Track resource utilization
- [ ] Analyze user experience metrics
- [ ] Optimize based on real-world usage

---

## Documentation Updates

### Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment runbooks
- [ ] Document any new environment variables
- [ ] Update infrastructure diagrams
- [ ] Record deployment decisions in decision log

### User-facing Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update CLI documentation
- [ ] Update SDK documentation
- [ ] Publish release notes

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Assess impact and severity
2. **Containment**: Implement immediate fixes or rollback
3. **Investigation**: Identify root cause
4. **Resolution**: Implement permanent fix
5. **Post-mortem**: Document lessons learned

### Communication Plan
- **Internal**: Slack #incidents, email stakeholders
- **External**: Status page updates, user notifications
- **Timeline**: Updates every 15 minutes during incidents

---

## Automation Scripts

### Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health-check.sh
curl -f http://api.pod-protocol.com/health || exit 1
curl -f http://app.pod-protocol.com/ || exit 1
echo "All services healthy"
```

### Deployment Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh
set -e

echo "Starting deployment..."
./scripts/pre-deployment-checks.sh
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
./scripts/post-deployment-verification.sh
echo "Deployment completed successfully"
```

---

## Notes
- Always deploy backend before frontend
- Test deployments in staging environment first
- Keep deployment rollback procedures ready
- Monitor closely for first 30 minutes after deployment
- Document any issues or improvements for future deployments
