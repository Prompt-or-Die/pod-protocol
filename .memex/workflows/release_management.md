# Release Management Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow defines the release management process and changelog maintenance for the POD Protocol platform to ensure consistent, reliable releases.

---

## Release Types

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
Following semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

#### Major Version (X.0.0)
- **Breaking changes** to public APIs
- **Architecture changes** affecting compatibility
- **Major feature additions** changing core functionality
- **Security updates** requiring configuration changes

#### Minor Version (X.Y.0)
- **New features** with backward compatibility
- **API additions** that don't break existing code
- **Performance improvements**
- **New package dependencies**

#### Patch Version (X.Y.Z)
- **Bug fixes** that don't change functionality
- **Security patches** with minimal impact
- **Documentation updates**
- **Dependency updates** for security/stability

### Release Channels

#### Stable (Production)
- **Fully tested** and validated releases
- **Enterprise-ready** with full support
- **SLA coverage** for production use
- **Quarterly major releases**, monthly minor releases

#### Beta (Pre-release)
- **Feature-complete** but may contain bugs
- **Community testing** encouraged
- **Two-week testing** period before stable
- **No SLA** but community support available

#### Alpha (Development)
- **Work-in-progress** features
- **Breaking changes** may occur
- **Internal testing** only
- **Weekly releases** from development branch

### Version Management

#### Version Bumping Process
```bash

git add . && git commit -m "Bump version to $(cat package.json | jq -r .version)"

# Update all package versions consistently
./scripts/update-versions.sh v1.2.3
```

#### Git Tagging Strategy
```bash
# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3

# Tag format: v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}
# Example: v2.1.0, v2.1.1, v3.0.0
