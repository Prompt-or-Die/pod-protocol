## Current Sprint Retrospective

### Sprint: TypeScript SDK v2.0 Migration
**Period**: December 2024  
**Status**: 92% Complete

#### What Went Well ‚úÖ
- Successfully resolved duplicate method definitions across service classes
- Implemented comprehensive type definitions for all service interfaces
- Updated dependency versions to latest compatible releases
- Established consistent error handling patterns
- Maintained backward compatibility during migration

#### What Didn't Go Well ‚ùå
- Async/await initialization issues in ZK compression service constructor
- Some compilation errors took longer to resolve than expected
- Testing coverage gaps discovered during migration
- Documentation updates lagged behind code changes

#### What We Learned üìö
- Constructor-based async initialization is problematic - use factory patterns instead
- Type definition files (.d.ts) require careful maintenance during migrations
- Comprehensive test suites are crucial for large-scale refactoring
- Incremental migration approach works better than big-bang rewrites

#### Action Items üéØ
- [ ] Convert ZK compression service to async factory pattern
- [ ] Complete remaining compilation fixes
- [ ] Update all service documentation
- [ ] Implement missing test coverage
- [ ] Establish migration checklist for future updates

## Previous Retrospectives

### Sprint: Monorepo Setup and Organization
**Period**: November 2024  
**Status**: Completed

#### What Went Well ‚úÖ
- Successfully organized packages into logical structure
- Established consistent build and test patterns across packages
- Implemented shared configuration and tooling
- Created comprehensive documentation structure

#### What Didn't Go Well ‚ùå
- Initial package interdependencies were complex
- Some circular dependency issues emerged
- Build times increased with monorepo setup
- Version management across packages required careful coordination

#### What We Learned üìö
- Clear package boundaries are essential from the start
- Shared configuration reduces maintenance overhead
- Dependency graphs need regular review and cleanup
- Build optimization is crucial for developer experience

#### Action Items üéØ
- [x] Implement package dependency visualization
- [x] Optimize build pipelines for parallel execution
- [x] Establish clear package versioning strategy
- [x] Create package development guidelines

## Lessons Learned Database

### Technical Lessons

#### TypeScript & JavaScript
- **Lesson**: Async constructors are anti-patterns
- **Context**: ZK compression service initialization issues
- **Solution**: Use factory methods or initialization patterns
- **Applied**: Pending implementation

#### Package Management
- **Lesson**: Bun significantly improves build performance
- **Context**: Runtime selection decision
- **Solution**: Standardize on Bun for all JS/TS operations
- **Applied**: Fully implemented

#### Error Handling
- **Lesson**: Consistent error interfaces improve debugging
- **Context**: Various service integration issues
- **Solution**: Implement enhanced error handling patterns
- **Applied**: Implemented across most services

### Process Lessons

#### Migration Strategy
- **Lesson**: Incremental migration reduces risk
- **Context**: TypeScript SDK v2.0 migration
- **Solution**: Break large changes into smaller, testable chunks
- **Applied**: Current migration approach

#### Testing Strategy
- **Lesson**: Test coverage must be maintained during refactoring
- **Context**: Discovered gaps during SDK migration
- **Solution**: Implement test-first approach for major changes
- **Applied**: Establishing new testing protocols

#### Documentation
- **Lesson**: Documentation should be updated concurrently with code
- **Context**: Lag between code changes and documentation updates
- **Solution**: Include documentation updates in all PRs
- **Applied**: New development workflow requirement

## Team Insights

### Development Velocity
- Complex migrations take 2-3x longer than estimated
- Automated testing catches 80% of issues before manual testing
- Clear task breakdown improves estimation accuracy

### Code Quality
- Type safety significantly reduces runtime errors
- Consistent patterns improve maintainability
- Regular refactoring prevents technical debt accumulation

### Process Improvements
- Regular retrospectives help identify bottlenecks early
- Documentation as code improves accuracy and maintenance
- Automated validation reduces manual oversight burden

## Notes
- Retrospectives should be conducted at the end of each major milestone
- All team members should contribute to retrospective insights
- Action items should be tracked and reviewed in subsequent retrospectives
- Focus on systemic improvements rather than individual issues
