# Incident Response Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow defines the incident response procedures and postmortem processes for the POD Protocol platform to ensure rapid resolution and continuous improvement.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### P1 - Critical (Response: Immediate)
- **Complete service outage** affecting all users
- **Data loss or corruption** incidents
- **Security breaches** with confirmed unauthorized access
- **Payment/financial system** failures
- **SLA breaches** affecting enterprise customers

#### P2 - High (Response: 30 minutes)
- **Major feature unavailable** affecting >50% of users
- **Performance degradation** causing timeouts
- **Database connectivity** issues
- **Authentication system** problems
- **API failures** affecting core functionality

#### P3 - Medium (Response: 2 hours)
- **Minor feature impaired** affecting <50% of users
- **Non-critical performance** issues
- **Scheduled maintenance** overruns
- **Third-party service** disruptions
- **Documentation** or help system issues

#### P4 - Low (Response: Next business day)
- **Cosmetic issues** not affecting functionality
- **Minor UI glitches** 
- **Documentation typos**
- **Enhancement requests** disguised as bugs
- **Development environment** issues

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Alert (0-5 minutes)

#### Automatic Detection
- **Monitoring alerts**: System health monitors
- **Error rate spikes**: Application error tracking
- **Performance degradation**: Response time monitoring
- **Uptime checks**: External monitoring services

#### Manual Detection
- **User reports**: Support tickets or direct reports
- **Team member observation**: During development or testing
- **Third-party notifications**: External service providers

#### Initial Response Checklist
- [ ] Acknowledge alert within 5 minutes
- [ ] Create incident tracking record
- [ ] Determine initial severity classification
- [ ] Notify incident response team
- [ ] Begin initial investigation

### 2. Assessment and Triage (5-15 minutes)

#### Rapid Assessment Questions
1. **What is broken?** Specific system or feature affected
2. **How many users affected?** Scale of impact
3. **What is the user impact?** Severity of consequences
4. **Is this escalating?** Trend analysis
5. **Any data at risk?** Security and data integrity check

#### Communication Setup
- [ ] Create incident communication channel (#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-ID)
- [ ] Add relevant team members
- [ ] Establish incident commander
- [ ] Set up status page update process

### 3. Immediate Response (15-30 minutes)

#### Emergency Contacts
- **Incident Commander**: Primary decision maker
- **Technical Lead**: System expertise
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment
- **Product Manager**: Business impact assessment
- **Customer Success**: External communication

## Investigation Process

### Diagnostic Steps

#### 1. System Health Check
```bash
# Quick system status check
curl -f https://api.pod-protocol.com/health
systemctl status pod-api
docker ps | grep pod-
tail -f /var/log/pod-protocol/*.log
```

#### 2. Performance Analysis
```bash
# Performance diagnostics
htop                    # System resources
iotop                   # Disk I/O
netstat -tuln          # Network connections
```

#### 3. Error Analysis
```bash
# Error investigation
grep ERROR /var/log/pod-protocol/*.log | tail -100
journalctl -u pod-api --since "10 minutes ago"
docker logs pod-api-container --since=10m
```

---

## Resolution Strategies

### Immediate Mitigation

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Emergency rollback process
1. Identify last known good version
git log --oneline -10
docker images | head -10

2. Execute rollback
./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh

3. Verify system health
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

---

## Communication Protocol

### Internal Communication

#### Status Updates
**Every 15 minutes during P1/P2 incidents:**
```
**INCIDENT UPDATE [HH:MM]**
Incident: [Brief description]
Status: [INVESTIGATING/IDENTIFIED/FIXING/MONITORING/RESOLVED]
Impact: [User impact description]
Actions Taken: [What we've done]
Next Steps: [What we're doing next]
ETA: [Expected resolution time]
```

### External Communication

#### Customer Notification Templates

**Initial Notification (within 30 minutes)**
```
We are currently investigating reports of [issue description]. 
We will provide updates every 30 minutes until resolved.
Status: https://status.pod-protocol.com
```

**Resolution Notification**
```
The issue affecting [system/feature] has been resolved as of [time].
All services are now operating normally. 
We will publish a post-incident report within 48 hours.
```

## Post-Incident Process

### Post-Incident Review (Within 48 hours)

#### Review Meeting Agenda
1. **Incident timeline review**
2. **Root cause analysis**
3. **Response effectiveness assessment**
4. **Communication evaluation**
5. **Process improvement identification**
6. **Action items assignment**

#### Blameless Culture
- Focus on **systems and processes**, not individuals
- Encourage **honest discussion** of what happened
- Identify **learning opportunities**
- Create **systemic improvements**

## Notes
- Always prioritize user impact over technical perfection
- Communication is as important as technical resolution
- Learn from every incident, regardless of severity
- Maintain blameless culture to encourage honest reporting
- Update procedures based on real incident experiences
